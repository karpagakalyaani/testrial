beta decay means emission of electrons from the radioactive nucleus
In a common emmitter amplifier, the input signal is applied across base and emitter and output is taken from the collector and emitter.
An antenna uses electromagnetic waves of frequency 5MHz. For proper working, the size of the antenna should be  15m (height = wavelength/4 given: frequency,  wavelength = c/frequency)
if a car is travelling north on a straight road and its brakes are applied it will accelerate to the south.
Two sources are said to be coherent if they produce waves of same frequency with a constant phase difference. 
Visible light is dispersed more during fog, whereas infrared radiation is scattered less due to its long wavelength. Therefore, photos of objects taken with infrared radiation are clearer.
Which of the following is carried by the waves from one place to another ?  energy final level come
Which of the following pairs may give equal numerical values of the temperature of the human body ? Fahrenheit and celsius.
An electric heater rated 220 V and 550 W is connected to AC mains. The current drawn by it is (P = V/I)  2.5A.i
